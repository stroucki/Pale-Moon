Pale Moon with my mods
</h2>
<p>
Github repository is <a href="https://github.com/stroucki/Pale-Moon">here</a>.
</p>
<p>
Pale Moon is a browser that was forked from Firefox a while ago. It exists
because people were unhappy with the design direction that Firefox was taking.
It does not diverge much from the "browser for everyone" model. Builds
for Windoze and Linux are widely available, builds for Mac not really.
</p>
<p>
The average user of a web browser generally takes a binary
blob from a stranger and uses it for the vast majority of their activities
online. Even amongst my professional acquaintances, nobody rolls their own
web browser. Admittedly, Chromium takes massive resources and an age to set
up and  build,
but Pale Moon is a lot less demanding.
</p>
<p>
Pale Moon is a drop in replacement for Firefox. rsync 
Library/"Application Support"/Firefox to Library/"Application 
Support"/"Pale Moon" and start it.
<p>
In my opinion, so many people consuming code someone else cooked has had a 
pernicious effect on individual freedom. Certain interest groups conspire 
with standards orgs and browser developers to include features 
marginally useful for the user, but enabling spying, fingerprinting, 
analyzing, marketing, and packaging the user for the benefit of 
advertising concerns. APIs like battery status and geolocation are 
irrelevant to browsing. Serialization of screen data to ready it for 
exfiltration doesn't seem right either. Besides being an announcement for
compatible security holes, user agent strings allow tracking and promote
discrimination based on the user's choice of 
browser or unwillingness to upgrade. The developer of Pale Moon includes 
ad links on startup pages etc. That's sad. I aim to remove or disable 
those things.

Feel free to try it out. A binary download link for a Mac build of Pale 
Moon is below, but if you are a technical person I urge you to 
<b>build it yourself</b>. And you can

it if you wish.

Pull requests and bug reports welcome.

Pale Moon for Macintosh
</h2>
<p>
The build from source is shockingly easy, and completed in about 10
minutes on a Macbook Pro from several years back. If you want to try it out,
and not build it yourself, here is a binary unofficial build (so branded New
Moon) based on checkout
