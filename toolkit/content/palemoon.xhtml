  The child <em>waxed</em>, its soul burning with curiosity and <em>independence</em>. Growing and <em>evolving</em> into a completely different <em>Beast</em> than its ancestor.<br/>
  Slowly and steadily shedding its ancestor's form, alike a <em>Dragon</em> growing up. Expelling parts of the <em>old Beast</em> but embracing others.<br/>
  <br/>
  The Dragon <em>changed</em>, but never stopped <em>listening</em>. It kept <em>in touch</em> with its nature and those who would gaze upon its growing form.<br/>
  <br/>
  Not everyone could <em>follow</em> on the path taken, as the old bed of <em>withered roots</em> was left behind for a new world.
